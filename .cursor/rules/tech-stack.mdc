# Tech Stack

This project uses:

- **Backend**: PHP
- **Markup & styling**: HTML, CSS
- **Database**: MySQL
- **API**: RESTful API (implemented in PHP)
- **No JavaScript**: Do not add or suggest JavaScript. Keep all behavior server-side (PHP) and presentation in HTML/CSS only.

When suggesting code, features, or fixes:

- Use PHP for logic, APIs, and database access (MySQLi or PDO).
- Use HTML for structure and semantic markup.
- Use CSS for layout and styling.
- Design APIs as RESTful (proper HTTP methods, status codes, JSON or other clear response format).
- Do not introduce JavaScript; rely on form submissions, links, and server-rendered HTML for interactivity.
